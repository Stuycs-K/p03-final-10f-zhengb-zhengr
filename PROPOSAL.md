# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:
Ricky Zheng, Brian Zheng

# Intentions:
We will make a chatroom that multiple users can connect to, custimizing their username and seeing what everyone writes. In contrast to this, we will try to implement a feature where users can privatly message eachother.

# Intended usage:
Upon starting the program, users will enter the username that will be used to identify themselves. Then, they will chat in the lobby about anything. Arrow keys to move up and down in the chatbox. Private messages can also occur where users can privatly message eachother without everyone else in the public server knowing.


# Technical Details:

A description of your technical design. This should include:

How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.

Allocating memory: Storing the actual messages
Sockets: Connection between server and client, multiple socket connections
Shared Memory: See what users are connected, allows server to access everything
Processes
Signals: handles keyboard input, like arrow keys

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

 learn ncurses, focus on functionality of the chat, server + multiple client connections- Ricky
learn ncurses, focus more on the GUI,server + multiple client connections - Brian
# Intended pacing:

Jan 9: Have basic chatroom functionality done (playable)

Jan 12/13: MVP (server client connection + chatroom)

Jan 16: Username config, private messages if we have time
