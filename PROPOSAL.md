# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:
Ricky Zheng, Brian Zheng

# Intentions:
We want to create a hangman game that allows users to "party up" with other users to play with. There will also be a chat that the users can use to communicate with each other. This chat will be available to users in both the lobby (before they choose their party) and during the game.

# Intended usage:
Upon starting the program, users will enter the username that will be used to identify themselves. Then, they will chat in the lobby to determine their party members. They will then start the hangman game with their party, and play the game while discussing what they think the randomly generated word is and what letter they should guess.


# Technical Details:

A description of your technical design. This should include:

How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.

Allocating memory: Storing the actual messages, words for hangman
Sockets: Connection between server and client, multiple socket connections
Shared Memory: See what users are connected, allows server to acess everything



How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

Chatroom - Ricky
Game - Brian
# Intended pacing:

Jan 9: Have the basic singleplayer hangman game done (playable)

Jan 12/13: MVP (loading into singleplayer hangman + server client connection + chatroom)

Jan 16: Username config, partying up, private messages if we have time
